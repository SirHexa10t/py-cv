# py-cv

Is your Curriculum Vitae being Mundane-ulum Vite-nay?

Yes, this pun is bad, but the point remains - CVs are boring, both to write and read.
Wouldn't it be nice to have a CV that stands out in *any* different way?

The answer is **yes** again, and though I can't offer you a perfect solution, here's \*a\* solution: Clone my project, replace the main file's place-holder data, and send it to some HR worker ~~who has no Python installed and would think you're trying to hack her computer~~ to catch their attention as a unique submittor.
